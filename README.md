A responsive image gallery designed for high resolution images.

The project consists of a gallery, a viewer and a script for image preparation.

Before using the gallery, you have to process all of your images that will be part of your gallery with the node.js script. The processed images will be stored to your applications assets. During runtime everything runs client-side and there is no separate server-side communication involved. The viewer takes care that an optimal image quality is served based on the device resolution.

## How to use the gallery in your project
### Pre-requirements
Install **node (>= 4.2.2)** and **graphicsmagick**: http://www.graphicsmagick.org/README.html#installation

### Embed in your project

#### 1. Install angular2-image-gallery

```bash
npm install angular2-image-gallery --save
```

#### 2. Import angular2-image-gallery in your Angular 2 module

```javascript
imports: [
  BrowserModule,
  FormsModule,
  HttpModule,
  Angular2ImageGalleryModule <-----
],
```

#### 3. Import scripts (when using angular-cli add these lines in polyfills.ts)

```javascript
import 'web-animations-js/web-animations.min';
import 'hammerjs/hammer';
```

#### 4. Import styles (when using angular-cli add this line in styles.css)

```javascript
@import '~@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/deeppurple-amber.css';
@import '~https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons';
```

#### 5. Run convert script

```bash
node node_modules/angular2-image-gallery/convert.js <path/to/your/images>
```
Add a flag to define the order of the images inside the gallery

`-n` sort by file name (default)

`-d` sort chronologically by the original creation time (e.g. for coverages of a wedding)

`-c` sort by primary image color

Additional optional parameter to support multiple galleries. Add it if you want to put your images into a separate gallery.

`--gName=yourGalleryName` 

#### 6. Embed gallery in your template

```javascript
<gallery 
    [flexBorderSize]="3" 
    [flexImageSize]="7"
    [galleryName]="'yourGalleryName'" 
    (viewerChange)="yourNotificationFunction($event)">
</gallery>
```

All parameters are optional. You may play around on the demo site to find out what parameters suit your needs.

The viewerChange event notifies you when the viewer component gets opened or closed.

That's it, start your application and have a look!
