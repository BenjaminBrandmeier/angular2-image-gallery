----> **compatible with Angular 15+** <----

Responsive image gallery designed for high resolution images.

The project consists of a gallery (+ viewer) and a script for image preparation.

### Demo

[https://oidamo.de/blog/gallery-demo](https://oidamo.de/blog/gallery-demo)

### Fundamentals
Before using the gallery, you have to process all of your images with the **convert** script. 

The processed images will be stored to your applications assets.

The viewer takes care of an optimal image quality being served based on the users screen resolution.

### Installation

#### 1. Install graphicsmagick

Follow the instructions: [http://www.graphicsmagick.org/README.html#installation](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/README.html#installation)

#### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install angular2-image-gallery hammerjs --save
```

#### 3. Import modules

```javascript
imports: [
  ...,
  Angular2ImageGalleryModule,
  HammerModule
],
```

#### 4. Run convert script

```bash
node node_modules/angular2-image-gallery/convert.js <path/to/your/images>
```

Add a flag to define the order of the images inside the gallery

`-n` sort by file name (default)

`-d` sort chronologically by the original creation time

`-c` sort by primary image color

Additional optional parameter to support multiple galleries. Add it if you want to put your images into a separate gallery.

`--gName=yourGalleryName`

#### 5. Embed gallery in your template

```javascript
<gallery
    [flexBorderSize]="3"
    [flexImageSize]="7"
    [galleryName]="'yourGalleryName'"
    [maxRowsPerPage]="100"
    (viewerChange)="yourNotificationFunction($event)"
    [includeViewer]="true"
></gallery>
```

All parameters are optional.

* **[flexBorderSize]** used to define the border thickness between the images within the gallery.
* **[flexImageSize]** used to define the size of the images with the gallery (not the viewer).
* **[galleryName]** used when having multiple galleries.
* **[maxRowsPerPage]** maximum rows per gallery, this will add navigation arrows once the threshold is reached.
* **[viewerChange]** event fires once the viewer component gets opened or closed.
* **[includeViewer]** provides an option to manually place the viewer outside the default DOM structure. Defaults to true.
